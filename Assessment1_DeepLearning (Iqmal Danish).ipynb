        "One day while wandering around a clothing store at KL East Mall, you stumbled upon a pretty girl who is choosing a dress for Hari Raya. It turns out that the girl is visually impaired and had a hard time distinguishing between an abaya and a kebaya. To help people with the similar situation, you then decided to develop an AI system to identify the type of clothes using a Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). In order to train the network, you decide to use the Fashion MNIST dataset which is freely available on Pytorch.\n"

It turns out that the girl is visually impaired and had a hard time distinguishing between an abaya and a kebaya. To help people with the similar situation, you then decided to develop an AI system to identify the type of clothes using a Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet).

The possible reasons contributing to the accuracy's improvement are such as the better choice of learning rate which is 0.001. The learning rate cannot be too high and too low because it will give inaccurate result. Therefore, it is discovered through experimentation that learning rate at 0.001 is the most suitable for resnet50 because it gives more accurate and the best result.The Also, choosing a better pre-trained model such as resnet50 will also result in more accurate result.  </span>"
